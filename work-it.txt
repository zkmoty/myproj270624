Work It / Missy Elliott
-----------------------
DJ please, pick up your phone
I'm on the request line
This is a Missy Elliott one time exclusive
(C'mon, c'mon)

[Chorus]
Is it worth it, let me work it
I put my thang down, flip it and reverse it
{"I put my thang down, flip it and reverse it" - backwards 2X*}
If you got a big {*elephant noise*} let me search ya
To find out how hard I gotta work ya
{"I put my thang down, flip it and reverse it" - backwards 2X*}

[Verse 1]
I'd like to get to know ya, so I can show ya
Put the pussy on ya, like I told ya
Gimme all your numbers so I can phone ya
Your girl acting stank then call me ov-ah
Not on the bed, lay me on your sofa
Call before you come, I need to shave my cho-cha
You do or you don't or you will or you won't cha
Go downtown and eat it like a vul-cha
See my hips and my tips don'tcha
See my ass and my lips don'tcha
Lost a few pounds in my waist for ya
This the kinda beat that go wa-ta-ta
Ra-ta-ta-ta, ta-ta-ta-ta-ta
Sex me so good I say blah-blah-blah
Work it! I need a glass of wat-ah
Boy oh boy its good to know ya

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
If you're a fly gal, get your nails done
Get a pedicure, get your hair didd
Boy lift it up, lets make a toast-ah
Lets get drunk, its gon bring us clos-ah
Don't I look like a Halle Berry post-ah?
See dem Belvedere playin tricks on ya
Girlfriend wanna be like me nev-ah
You won't find a bitch that's even bett-ah
I make it hot as Las Vegas weath-ah
Listen up close while I take you backwards
{"Watch the way Missy like to take it backwards" - backwards*}
I'm not a prostitute but I can give you what ya want
I love your braids and your mouth full of fonts
Love the way my ass go ba-bump ba-bump bump
Keep your eyes on my ba-bump ba-bump bump
And think you can handle this badonkadonk-donk
Take my thong off and my ass go boom
Cut the lights off so you see what I can do

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Boys, boys, all type of boys
Black, white, Puerto Rican, Chinese boys
Wan tan taya taya tang-a-tang, wan tan taya taya tang-a-tang
Girls, girls, get that cash
If its 9 to 5 or shakin ya ass
Ain't no shame ladies, do your thang
Just make sure you ahead of tha game

Just cause I got a lot of fame sup-ah
Prince couldn't get me change my name papa
Kunta Kinte, enslave a game, no sir
Picture Black Say'n, "Oh yessa massa"
Picture Lil' Kim dating a pastor
Minute Man, big Red can outlast ya
Who is the best? I don't have to ask ya
When I come out, you won't even matt-ah
Why you act dumb like ughhh, duh
So you act dumb like ughhh, duh
And the drummer boy go pa-rum pa-pum pum
Give ya some some some of this Cinnabon

[Chorus]

To my fellas, ooooh
Good God, I like the way you work that
To my ladies, woo
You sure know how to work that, good God
