Snow ((Hey Oh)) / Red Hot Chili Peppers
---------------------------------------
Come to decide that
The things that I tried
Were in my life
Just to get high on

When I sit alone
Come get a little known
But I need more
Than myself this time

Step from the road
To the sea to the sky
And I do believe
That we rely on

When I lay it on
Come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

Hey oh
Listen what I say oh
I got your hey oh
Now listen what I say oh

When will I know
That I really can't go
To the well once more
Time to decide on

When it's killing me
When will I really see
All that I need to look inside

Come to believe
That I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride

When it's killing me
What do I really need
All that I need to look inside

Hey oh
Listen what I say oh
Come back and hey oh
Look at what I say oh

The more I see, the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey oh, woah

Deep beneath the cover
Of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow

Privately divided
By a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go

In between the cover
Of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow

Running through the field
Where all my tracks
Will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

When to descend
To amend for a friend
All the channels
That have broken down

Now you bring it up
I'm gonna ring it up
Just to hear you sing it out

Step from the road
To the sea to the sky
And I do believe
What we rely on

When I lay it on
Come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

Hey oh
Listen what I say oh
I got your hey oh
Listen what I say oh

The more I see the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey oh

Deep beneath the cover
Of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow

Privately divided
By a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go

In between the cover
Of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow

Running through the field
Where all my tracks
Will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

I said hey, hey, yeah
Oh yeah, tell my love now
Hey, hey, yeah
Oh yeah, tell my love now

Deep beneath the cover
Of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow

Privately divided
By a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go

Deep beneath the cover
Of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow

Running through the field
Where all my tracks
Will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

I said hey, oh yeah
Oh yeah, tell my love now
Hey, yeah, yeah, oh yeah
