[People in background chatting]
Yo, yo yo move out of the way
We got missy Elliott coming through
Girl that is missy Elliott she lost a lot of weight
Girl I heard she eats one cracker a day
Oh well I heard the bitch was married to Tim and started fucking with Trina
I heard the bitch got hit with three zebras and a monkey
I can't stand the bitch no way

[Missy]
When I walk up in the piece
I ain't gotta even speak
I'm a bad mamajama goddammit motherfuckers ain't gotta like me

And stop talking bout who I'm sticking and licking jus mad it ain't yours

[Ludacris]
Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Cris
Nobody paid him any mind
No one gave a shit
Knowing he could rap
No one lifted a hands
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block
50 thousand sold
Seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone
Three years later
Steeped out the swamp
With ten and a half gators
All around the world on the microphone
Leaving your boobs smelling like Burberry cologne
Still riding chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen
Never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect you'll give me
Ludacris I live loud just like Timmy
Fuck, have to clear these rumors
I got a headache and &amp;quot;it's not a tumor&amp;quot;
Get up on my lap and keep my head sucked right
Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bight
Hard to the core
Core to the right
Who taught yall turn around pick a bale of pike

[Chorus]

[People in the background chatting]
Yo, straight up Missy killed that shit tonight for real
I know I know, I don't even care about her beign preganant by Michael Jackson
You know what we should do
We should go get her album when it comes out
There she go, there she go, there she
Heeeey Misssy

[Missy]
Hi Missy?
What's up fools?
You think I aint knowin yall broke Milli Vanilli
Jay Jay fan wannabes aint over here gossiping bout me?
Yo how bout you buff these Pumas for 20 cents so your lights wont get cut off
You soggy breasts, cow stomachs
Yo take those baby GAP shirts off, too
You just mad cuz Payless ran out of plastic pumps for the after party
Yo by the way, go get my album
Damn!
